Aging is a feature in BreweryX that allows you to age your brews in barrels.
When a brew is aged, it will gain additional effects and values based on the brew's recipe.
The aging process is option on a per-brew basis and can be configured for each brew in the `recipes.yml` file.

### Creating a Barrel

> To age a brew, you must first create a barrel.
Barrels can be created by placing a sign on a collection of blocks with the text **Barrel** on it.

After you put your drinks in barrels, you just need to wait! 1 "year" is equals 1 in-game day.
If you overdo the drink or use the wrong type of wood, the drink is likely to spoil.
