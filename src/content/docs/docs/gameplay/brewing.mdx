### Getting Started

After installing and configuring, it's time to brew some potions! Unlike in vanilla Minecraft, it's not as easy as adding an ingredient to a brewing Stand and waiting for it to finish. Depending on the recipe the whole process can be difficult and time consuming. Some recipes may need a high precision when it comes to ingredients or any other step in the process. If particular step was done incorrectly or at the wrong time, the quality of the potion may suffer or you'll end up with an entirely different brew!

Depending on the Recipe, some steps may not be needed, the following instructions describes the most common procedure of brewing.


#### Brewing

<Steps>

1. Obtain a cauldron and fill it with water.

2. Add a heat source under your cauldron. This can be one of many:
    - Fire or soul fire
    - Lava or magma blocks
    - Campfire or soul campfire

3. Add the ingredients for your recipe by right clicking the cauldron with each one.

4. Use a **clock** on the cauldron to see how long the drink has been brewing for.

5. When the cauldron has brewed for the instructed amount of time, use **3** glass bottles to fully extract the contents of the cauldron.

At this point, for some recipes, you may be done! Other recipes may require aging and/or distilling. Please proceed
