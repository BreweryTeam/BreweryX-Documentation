The BreweryX configuration (config.yml), is pretty straightforward. This documentation may not always be
up to date, and we advise you to check your config.yml along with each config key's comments.

## General Configuration

# The used Ingredients and other brewing-data is saved to all Brewery Items. To prevent
# hacked clients from reading what exactly was used to brew an item, the data can be encoded/scrambled.
# This is a fast process to stop players from hacking out recipes, once they get hold of a brew.

# Only drawback: brew items can only be used on another server with the same encodeKey.
# When using Brews on multiple (BungeeCord) Servers, define a MYSQL database in the 'storage' settings.

# So enable this if you want to make recipe cheating harder, but don't share any brews by world download, schematics, or other means. [false]
