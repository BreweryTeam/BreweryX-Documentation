# The cauldron.yml file

The `cauldron.yml` file is used to configure effects and outputs of Brewery cauldrons based on the ingredients used.

## How is it used?

Cauldron.yml entries are used to make cauldrons more intuitive, by giving varying cauldron particles, and specific
`cauldron brews`. These `cauldron brews` do not have any special effects and cannot be aged or distilled.
`cauldron brews` will be outputted by cauldrons when there is no matching recipe or when a recipe requires aging or
distilling to be completed. You can think of these brews as 'intermediate' or 'failed' brews. Lastly, cook particles
will always appear as long as matching ingredients have been found.

## Definining a cauldron.yml entry

Let's declare a `cauldron.yml` entry!

```yaml title="cauldron.yml" frame="code"
cauldron:
  # The key of the cauldron entry. This doesn't really matter, but it must be unique.
  exampleKey:
    # Note: Brews declared here only come out of cauldrons when the cauldron CANNOT find a matching recipe!
    # These entries will not override any declared recipes in your `recipes.yml` file.
    name: Unknown Brew # The name of the brew.
    color: BLACK # The color of the brew.
    customModelData: 545 # The custom model data of the brew.
    # The lore of the brew.
    lore:
      - You just created a completely useless brew!
    # The ingriends that must be used to make this cauldron brew. One or more ingredients must match.
    ingredients:
      - Bedrock/2
      - Diamond
    # The cooking particles that will be used when brewing. Only ingredients have to match!
    cookParticles:
      - RED/5
      - WHITE/10
      - 800000/25
```
