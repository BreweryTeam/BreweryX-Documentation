BreweryX supports addons that can add new features to the plugin. 
This can be new brewing recipes, custom items, or other features. 
This section documents how to create an addon for BreweryX.

### Choosing a language

BreweryX supports addons compiled down to Java >=17. We also support Kotlin natively.
If you're using Kotlin in your project, please **don't** shade in its standard libraries!

### Creating an addon

See our [template repository](https://github.com/BreweryTeam/ExampleBreweryAddon) addons for project setup and what dependencies to include.

After setting up your project, you'll need a main class that extends BreweryAddon and implements the `onAddonEnable` method.


<Tabs syncKey="language">
    <TabItem label="Java">
```java title="MyAddon.java" frame="code"
import com.dre.brewery.api.addons.BreweryAddon;
import com.dre.brewery.api.addons.AddonInfo;    

@AddonInfo(name = "MyAddon", version = "1.0", author = "Jsinco")
public class MyAddon extends BreweryAddon {
    @Override
    public void onAddonEnable() {
        // Code which is executed when MyAddon is enabled
    }

    @Override
    public void onAddonDisable() {
        // Code which is executed when BreweryX is disabled
    }

    @Override
    public void onBreweryReload() {
        // Code which is executed when `/breweryx reload` is executed
    }
}
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin">

    override fun onAddonEnable() {
        // Code which is executed when MyAddon is enabled
    }

    override fun onAddonDisable() {
        // Code which is executed when BreweryX is disabled

    override fun onBreweryReload() {

    }
